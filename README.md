# HW10_team_profile
The goal of this assignment was to create an application that allows me to create a profile html for a team of developers with name, position, email address, id number, office number for Managers, github username for engineers, and school for interns.
Classes were made to accomplish the task of creating the card objects with inputs from the user using Node.js inquirer.
